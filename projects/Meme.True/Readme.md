## Project Overview

**Description**:  
Meme.true targets the hot meme market to bring a mix of humour, degen, and brainrot. 
Right now the meme-community and the meme-coin community have become two different things, I want to bring them all under one umbrella. The app solves this problem by creating a meme-creator economy, with the help of the web3 financial aspect, and be able to post quality memes.

**Key Features**:  
- All-in-one: Capture and Edit the meme in the app itself. 
- Humour Incentivized: Earn even through doomscrolling, just vote for your favorite meme.

**Technology Stack**:  
- **Blockchain/Parachains**: Polkadot, Zeitgeist, True Network 
- **Frontend**: Next.js
<!-- - **Centralised Component (if any)**: (e.g., Node.js, Rust, etc.)   -->
- **Other Useful Tools**: IPFS
