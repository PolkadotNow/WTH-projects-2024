## Project Overview

**Description**:  
PixelProof is a consumer dapp which solves the problem of Digital Image Provenance, Today, people don't have a proper way to check, Who is the Owner of the Image? or, Is the Image generated by AI? or Has someone edited a pre-existing Image to modify it in order to claim the Ownership? and more. These problems may look small but they are very big in terms of Intellectual Property Rights, Authenticity Rights, Ownership Rights, etc.

PixelProof solve these problem by extracting the metadata of Image and attesting on to blockchain to store the attestation permanently. This way anyone can look, Who is the owner of Image?, How many times has it been edited?, Who edited the Image? Has there been any change in Ownership? 

**Key Features**:  
- In-built Camera  
- Attestation onto the blockchain
- Editor

**Technology Stack**:  
- **Blockchain/Parachains**: True Network  
- **Frontend**: Nextjs 
- **Centralised Component (if any)**: Nodejs  
- **Other Useful Tools**: IPFS, TypeScript, Shadcn, Magic UI, Acceternity UI, Vercel

## Progress & Changelog

Use this section to document your daily updates during the hackathon.  

### Day 1 27/11/2024:
- Achievements: Successful Ideation of ProofPixel
- Challenges: I planned to build something related to Computing Solution or using FHE, ZKP but there was nothing much to build on the Consumer side. Thanks to mentors who helped me to come up with the idea of Digital Image Provenance

### Day 2 28/11/2024:
- Achievements: Initialised Frontend using Nextjs, TypeScript, Shadcn, Magc UI, Acceternity UI. Completed the basic Landing Page.
- Challenges: As I setup the polka-dapp, I came across signTransaction (through in-built Wallet Provider) problem which took a lot of time to solve, and again thanks to mentors to solve it beside me.

### Day 3 29/11/2024:
- Achievements: Could not made a good progress due to debugging.
- Challenges: Hydration error took a lot of time to debug the application.

### Day 4 30/11/2024:
- Achievements: Completed the basic UI and integrated in-built Camera on the Frontend.
- Challenges: Finding a good Camera library was a bit tough because every package could not support the Versions. 

### Day 5 01/12/2024:
- Achievements: Integrated True Network SDK, Editor and close to live the project.
- Challenges: Integrating Editor was also tough due to the Versions.

### Day 6 02/12/2024:
- Achievements: Finalized MVP is live.
- Challenges: Editor setup was not easy to integrate because Server Side Rendering is not involved.
